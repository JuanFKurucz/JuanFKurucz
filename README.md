### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a highly skilled and experienced computer scientist with a passion for using technology to make the world a better place.

I have a strong background in software engineering and artificial intelligence, and have been recognized for my expertise in these fields through my work as a university professor and academic researcher.

In addition to my professional accomplishments, I am also dedicated to giving back to the community as a volunteer for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

As a game developer, I have proven myself to be creative and adaptable, and am able to approach problems from unique angles.

In my free time, I enjoy staying active and exploring my creative interests.
